# Financial Banking Transaction Data Analysis Using Power BI

## Project Description
FinInsight Group, a consultancy specializing in banking analytics, undertakes a project to analyze financial data using Power BI. The project utilizes two comprehensive datasets: 'Banking Transactions' and 'Customer Account Details'. The 'Banking Transactions' dataset includes detailed transaction data such as types, amounts, dates, and branch information. The 'Customer Account Details' dataset provides insights into account holders, covering account types, balances, interest rates, credit scores, and loan amounts. This analysis is crucial in a sector where financial data drives strategic decisions in customer relationship management, risk assessment, and product offerings.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to employ Power BI to analyze these banking datasets, aiming to unravel the intricate patterns and behaviors within the data. This involves in-depth data cleaning, robust data modeling, and strategic use of DAX for complex analytics. The goal is to create a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that not only illustrates transactional trends and customer profiles but also offers a holistic view of the banking ecosystem. The analysis includes understanding customer transaction behaviors, identifying relationships between account characteristics and financial health, and exploring factors influencing credit scores and loan management. These insights will guide FinInsight Group in advising banking institutions on optimizing their services, enhancing customer satisfaction, and managing financial risks effectively.
